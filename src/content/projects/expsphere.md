ExpSphere is an innovative goal-tracking web application that visualizes your life experiences through a unique liquid sphere interface. The platform allows users to set personal goals and track their progress by adding experiences that gradually fill a virtual sphere with liquid, representing the accumulation of life experiences and achievements.

## Key Features

**Liquid Sphere Visualization**: The core of ExpSphere features a mesmerizing 3D sphere filled with liquid that represents your accumulated experiences. As you add new experiences and complete goals, the liquid level rises, creating a beautiful visual representation of your personal growth journey.

**Experience Tracking**: Users can log various life experiences, from learning new skills to achieving personal milestones. Each experience contributes to filling the sphere, making progress tangible and motivating.

**Goal Management**: Set specific goals with timelines and track your progress towards achieving them. The sphere's liquid level reflects your overall progress across all active goals.

**Interactive Interface**: The web application provides an intuitive and engaging user experience with smooth animations and responsive design that works across all devices.

**Progress Analytics**: View detailed analytics of your experience accumulation over time, helping you understand patterns in your personal development journey.

## Technical Implementation

Built with modern web technologies, ExpSphere features a responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes. The liquid sphere effect is achieved through advanced CSS animations and JavaScript, creating a visually stunning and interactive experience that motivates users to continue their personal development journey.
