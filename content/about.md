![about](/img/about.png)
Hello! I'm Furkan Saffet Olkay, an experienced software developer with a strong focus on Flutter. With over five years of experience in mobile development and a proven track record in managing development teams, I specialize in building high-performance, cross-platform applications that deliver exceptional user experiences.

Throughout my career, I've designed and developed innovative mobile applications, and served as a Mobile Developer Manager, leading teams in creating robust and scalable solutions. While Flutter remains my primary strength, I have recently started learning backend development with Java and Spring Boot to expand my skillset. I'm excited to continue growing in this area and building my knowledge of backend technologies.

I'm passionate about writing clean, maintainable code and constantly learning new technologies to stay ahead in a rapidly evolving tech landscape.
