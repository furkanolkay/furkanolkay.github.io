![about](/img/about.png)
Hello! I’m Furkan Saffet Olkay, an experienced software developer with a strong focus on Flutter and a growing expertise in backend development with Java and Spring Boot. With over five years of experience in mobile development and a proven track record in managing development teams, I specialize in building high-performance, cross-platform applications that deliver exceptional user experiences.

Throughout my career, I’ve designed and developed innovative mobile applications, and served as a Mobile Developer Manager, leading teams in creating robust and scalable solutions. While Flutter remains my primary strength, I have also been expanding into backend development—designing RESTful APIs and microservices using Java and the Spring Boot framework. This full-stack perspective helps me build more integrated and efficient systems, bridging the gap between frontend and backend.

I'm passionate about writing clean, maintainable code and constantly learning new technologies to stay ahead in a rapidly evolving tech landscape.
